# Middlewares for golang's [neo][1] web frame
https://github.com/ivpusic/neo

----------

comparing to [gin][2], neo's router is based on Regex, which means easy to use, without any conflict and confusing.(which gin/echo has) 

gin/echo's router makes your route design much harder, much longer, which is not human friendly. neo won't have those problems.

It's kind like nodejs' express/koa web frame, but in golang. So if you are a nodejs->golang user, you gonna like it.
